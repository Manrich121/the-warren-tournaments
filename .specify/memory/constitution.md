# The Warren Tournaments Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) for a server-rendered Single Page Application (SPA).
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes for serverless functions.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL as the relational database.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- **ORM**: Prisma as the Object-Relational Mapper for database access.

### II. Component-Based Architecture
- All UI elements MUST be built as reusable React components.
- Components SHOULD be functional components using React Hooks.
- Each component MUST have a clear, single responsibility.

### III. State Management
- Client-side state SHOULD be managed with React Context or Zustand for complex state.
- Server-side state (data fetching) MUST be handled with a library like SWR or React Query.

### IV. Database Management
- Database schema changes MUST be managed through Prisma Migrate.
- Direct database access is prohibited; all access MUST go through the Prisma client.

### V. API Design
- APIs MUST follow RESTful principles.
- API routes MUST be defined in the `pages/api` directory.
- All API responses SHOULD be in JSON format.

### VI. Testing
- Unit tests MUST be written for all critical components and utility functions using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Integration tests SHOULD be written for user flows.
- End-to-end tests MAY be written for critical paths using a framework like Cypress or Playwright.

## Technology Stack and Architecture

This project is a modern web application leveraging the Next.js framework for both frontend and backend development. The architecture is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and efficient.

- **Next.js**: Provides a robust framework for building server-rendered React applications, with features like file-based routing, API routes, and server-side rendering.
- **React**: A declarative, component-based library for building user interfaces.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **Prisma**: A next-generation ORM that makes it easy to work with databases.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Development Workflow

- All code changes MUST be submitted as pull requests.
- All pull requests MUST be reviewed by at least one other developer.
- All pull requests MUST pass all automated checks (linting, testing) before being merged.

## Governance

- This constitution is the single source of truth for all development practices.
- Amendments to this constitution require a pull request and approval from the project maintainers.
- All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with this constitution.
