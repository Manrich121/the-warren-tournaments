# Feature Specification: Player Stats and Leaderboard Calculations

**Feature Branch**: `002-player-stats-and`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Player stats and leaderboard calculations should be calculated as: League leaderboard is determined by event points. A player earns event points per event, 1 point for attendance, 1 point for 3rd place, 2 points for 2nd place and 3 points for 1st in an event. Event rankings are determined by a player's match points accross all round played in the event. Players earn 3 match points for each match win, 0 points for each match loss, and 1 match point for each match ending in a draw. Game points are similar to match points in that players earn 3 game points for each game they win 1 point for each game that ends in a draw, and 0 points for any game lost. When determining the ranking in a particular event, if two or more players are tied use tiebreakers in the order 1. Match point, 2. Opponents‚Äô match-win percentage, 3. Game-win percentage, 4. Opponents‚Äô game-win percentage. A player‚Äôs match-win percentage is that player‚Äôs accumulated match points divided by the total match points possible in those rounds (generally, 3 times the number of rounds played). If this number is lower than 0.33, use 0.33 instead. A player‚Äôs game-win percentage is the total number of game points they earned divided by the total game points possible (generally, 3 times the number of games played). Again, use 0.33 if the actual game-win percentage is lower than that. A player‚Äôs opponent‚Äôs match-win percentage is the average match-win percentage of each opponent that the player faced. Similar to opponents‚Äô match-win percentage, a player‚Äôs opponent‚Äôs game-win percentage is simply the average game-win percentage of all that player‚Äôs opponents. And, as with opponents‚Äô match-win percentage, each opponent has a minimum game-win percentage of 0.33. The leaderboard on the dashboard page should be the leaderboard of the current active league. When viewing a particular league the leaderboard should be calculated based on all the events in that league. When viewing an event, the leaderboard should be the Event rankings of the particular event."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (Player), actions (earns points, is ranked), data (Match, Event, League, Points), constraints (tie-breaker rules)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale (Core Web Vitals compliance)
   - Error handling behaviors and user feedback
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - Responsive design breakpoints
   - Form validation and error messaging
   - Loading states and async operation feedback

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a player, I want to see my ranking on the leaderboard for the current league, a specific league, or a specific event, so that I can track my performance against other players based on a clear and fair scoring system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** a player has participated in an event, **When** they view the event's leaderboard, **Then** they should see their ranking calculated based on match points and specified tie-breakers.
2.  **Given** a player has earned event points from multiple events in a league, **When** they view the league's leaderboard, **Then** they should see their ranking based on the sum of their event points.
3.  **Given** two players in an event have the same number of match points, **When** the event leaderboard is calculated, **Then** their relative ranking should be determined by the tie-breaker rules in the correct order.
4.  **Given** a user is on the dashboard page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the leaderboard for the currently active league should be displayed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a player has not played any matches in an event?
  - A player with no matches should have 0 match points and be ranked accordingly.
- How are rankings displayed if all players have zero points?
  - Order players alphabetically by name if all have zero points.
- What happens if an opponent's match-win percentage cannot be calculated (e.g., they have played no matches)?
  - If a player has not played any matches, they will not have any opponents.
- How is the "active" league determined for the dashboard leaderboard?
  - An active league is defined as the most recent league with ongoing or upcoming events.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST calculate a player's total match points for an event by summing points from all matches played (3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss).
- **FR-002**: The system MUST calculate a player's total game points for an event by summing points from all games played (3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST calculate a player's match-win percentage for an event as their total match points divided by the total possible match points. This value MUST NOT be less than 0.33.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST calculate a player's game-win percentage for an event as their total game points divided by the total possible game points. This value MUST NOT be less than 0.33.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST calculate an opponent's match-win percentage as the average of the match-win percentages of all of a player's opponents in an event.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST calculate an opponent's game-win percentage as the average of the game-win percentages of all of a player's opponents in an event.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST rank players within an event leaderboard based on the following criteria in order: 1. Match Points, 2. Opponent's Match-Win Percentage, 3. Game-Win Percentage, 4. Opponent's Game-Win Percentage.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST award event points to players based on their final ranking in an event: 3 points for 1st, 2 points for 2nd, 1 point for 3rd, and 1 point for attendance.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST calculate a player's league ranking by summing all event points earned within that league.
- **FR-010**: The dashboard page MUST display the leaderboard for the currently active league.
- **FR-011**: The league details page MUST display a leaderboard calculated from all events within that league.
- **FR-012**: The event details page MUST display a leaderboard reflecting the event-specific rankings.
